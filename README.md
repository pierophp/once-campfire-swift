# once-campfire-swift

A Swift 6.4 / Hummingbird 2 server skeleton for the ONCE Campfire benchmark port. SQLite 3.53.4 is compiled from the vendored amalgamation with FTS5 and SQLite multi-thread mode.

## Build and test

```sh
swift build -c release
swift test
```

The HTTP black-box test uses a fresh copy of the Rust parity seed when available. Set `CAMPFIRE_SEED_DIR` to the seed directory if it is outside this checkout. The test skips with a message when the seed is missing; set `CAMPFIRE_REQUIRE_SEED=1` to make that a failure.

## Run

```sh
docker build -t campfire-swift .
docker run --rm \
  -e HTTP_PORT=80 \
  -v "$PWD/parity/.seed/default/db:/rails/storage/db" \
  -v "$PWD/parity/.seed/default/storage:/rails/storage/files" \
  -p 8080:80 campfire-swift
```

The image listens on plain HTTP at `HTTP_PORT` (default `80`), opens `/rails/storage/db/production.sqlite3`, and responds to `GET /up`. It does not select a container `USER`, so the benchmark harness can pass its host uid. The NIO event-loop group uses the process's allowed CPU list, then the cgroup cpuset, to size its threads.
